                In this Social autopsy, I will be discussing Isabell. Isabell is a very unique character because a lot of the development of her character happens before the book even Takes place But she almost takes us through her character development while talking to other characters who don’t know she’s changed. I will talk about the beginning middle and end of the book explaining how Isabell changed throughout it and how the other characters saw her go through that change.

                To answer the question does Isabell develop a lot during the book shooter is complicated, because she develops a lot before the book starts which to some people would make it seem like she doesn’t have a lot to develop as a character. However, that is incorrect, because The book is told through the five Different main characters gives a lot of room for each character to develop through the eyes of the other main characters. For example, Isabel changed a lot as a character before everyone was locked in a bathroom together but when she found out Xander was in the bathroom with them she went back to how she was before going on her trip But after talking to him one on one he saw the changes that had happened to her before the book even started. As well as going from someone who goes from party to party with her friends and boyfriend To then not wanting to party you because she wished to focus on things that were more meaningful in life.

                Around the middle of the novel is when a lot of characters start changing from what everyone assumes they are to what they actually are as a person and with Isabell that is no exception. Not only does Isabell share her true self with everyone she starts to understand other people‘s true selves And that’s shown best when she learns that Hogan blamed himself for Randy’s death especially Because she thought that just telling him it wasn’t his fault was good enough. It also went the same way with people figuring out who the true Isabell is with her opening up about her mental health issues and cutting herself And how her parents are really hard on her. Another way the characters relate to Isabell is when she finds out her boyfriend cheated on her with her best friend BRI, it showed a huge vulnerability for her because she wasn’t expecting it from anyone especially you know from her best friend and that’s when it really caused her to turn to the people she thought she was stuck in a bathroom realizing she was actually with friends. One of the best examples about how much they were learning about each other was When Isabell was talking about how she was stressing about her grades and what college she was getting into when Hogan made the assumption that she had Asian parents when she was adopted, It isn’t a huge thing about Isabell in the first place but it went far to show how Much Hogan and everyone assumed about her.
                CSS is the basis for all designing and positioning of your webpage. It is used primarily for changing how HTML looks. A CSS rule is more properties being applied to a single HTML element for example positioning a button in the middle of the screen and making the button green. A CSS Der is how you start making a CSS rule by using the HTML tags, Example the way you would style your green button easy you would have a class called the button and you would use that in CSS to position it and make it green

                The end of the novel shows the last little bit of character development that Isabell has where she goes from everyone thinking she’s a stuck up little girl who gets whatever she wants because she’s rich to being someone that wants to make a genuine impact on her school and do what’s right. A few moments that she shows that best is when she Is backing up Hogan, Alice and Noah after knowing who they truly are when at the beginning of the book she didn’t want to even be anywhere near them in the washroom. As well as possibly the best example of her development is her relationship with Xander and that takes a huge step at the end of the book when she actually goes to visit him in the hospital, talks to him and gives him her old camera Which shows that she paid attention to him as well as relates to him when she talks about how She enjoys taking photos as he does.

            <p class="article-p">
                In conclusion, Isabel did a lot of developing before and during the book going from hating Xander to eventually being good enough friends with him to visit him in the hospital As well as deciding she no longer wanted to go to parties with her friends. All the points showed that she developed a lot as a character from beginning to end even though it seemed that a lot of that didn’t happen during the book.

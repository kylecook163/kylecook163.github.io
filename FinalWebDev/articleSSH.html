                In this article we will be explaining security and privacy on websites, how to identify secure websites from ones that aren’t, SSL and TSL what what exactly they are and finally how to make sure you are safe online.
            </p>
            <p class="article-p">
                First thing we need to do to under stand security online is Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) which is the slandered for keeping websites connection to you secure. It also blocks sensitive data from being read or modified by any third parties trying to get your information. It does this by encrypting all information sent to and from the website you are using (for example when you are buying anything online using a credit card). By encrypting the data it prevents hackers from even getting part of your information because it’s unreadable.
            </p>
            <p class="article-p">
                Now that we know what SSL is we can get into Transport Layer Security or (TLS) which is basically a more secure version of SSL. Whenever you see that a website has a SSL certificate they actually have a TLS certificate but SSL is more commonly used.
            </p>
            <p class="article-p">
                Hypertext Transfer Protocol or (HTTP) is a protocol for presenting information to users and transferring information over networks mostly the internet. All HTTP information is sent over networks in plaintext which is an issue for everyone who uses it because anyone who is monitoring the connection can read it (for example someone can easily read your credit card info information while you are buying something) which isn’t the best design.
            </p>
            <p class="article-p">
                Which brings us to Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure or (HTTPS) Which is basically HTTP but with SSH or TLS. HTTPS is what most websites use and that’s how you know if it’s a more trustable website or not.
            </p>
            <p class="article-p">
                Now that we know the basics of what secure
                websites use we can find which websites are
                secure. You always want to find websites that
                use HTTPS and not HTTP because it has that
                secure element to it. You also want to find
                websites that don’t try and access all your
                information because even though they use HTTPS doesn’t mean they can’t get your information other ways.
            </p>
            <p class="article-p">
                The last thing I would like to let you know is other ways you can be safer online. One of the biggest ways to stay safe is to have a VPN when you are browsing the Internet, one of the best VPN that I’ve used is Nord VPN which I will leave a link for you to find there website they have a great VPN and password manager that you can use for a pretty low cost. Finally you want to make sure you can what websites do on your computer, you can manage that by not blindly downloading anything websites tell you to.

                In this article, I will be telling you how to carve a pumpkin best. With carving pumpkins being so popular, it only makes sense to have hundreds of different ways to carve them. The best way to start is by picking which pumpkin is best, and you don’t want to choose a mouldy pumpkin or anything. Not a pumpkin in the picture.

                After you pick your perfect pumpkin, you want to decide what you would like to carve into it. There are many ways you can come to this decision, including thinking of an idea, finding one on the internet, or asking a friend. 
            </p>
            <p class="article-p">
                After picking what you would like to carve into the pumpkin next, you will want to take all the guts out of the pumpkin. To do that, you will want to cut a circle around the pumpkin’s stem. Then stick your hand in the pumpkin and scoop out all the guts(which you can use the seeds to make a Delicious snack afterwards).
            </p>
            <p class="article-p">
                Now you can trace what you want to carve into your pumpkin. Make sure to use a sharpy, preferably a thin tip, but a regular sharpy works just fine, then cut away until you get what you’ve traced on your pumpkin.

                After carving your pumpkin, you can insert either a real or fake candle. A real candle can add a better Halloween experience, but you need to keep an eye on it. With a phony candle, you can leave it on for hours, even days, without needing to worry about it.
            </p>
            <p class="article-p">
                Now that you know how to carve a pumpkin, you can carve as many as you would like. Let’s not forget about the pumpkin seeds you set aside. Now that you are done with all the carving, we can make a little snack for everyone to enjoy. All you need to do is clean the seeds in cold water, getting rid of the pumpkin guts. After that’s done, then add them into some boiling saltwater, let cook for 5 minutes, then strain the water out and add any seasonings you might like onto them, and then an excellent snack for the whole family.
